		Hello. It's me. I was wondering<br/>if after all these years you'd like to meet<br/> 
		to go over everything.<br/> 
		I hear that times supposed to heal,<br/> 
		but I ain't done much healing.<br/> 
		Hello?<br/> 
		Can you hear me?<br/> 
		I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be.<br/>
		 When we were younger and free.<br/> 
		 I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet.<br/> There's such a difference between us, 
		 and a million miles.<br/> 
		 Hello from the other siiiiddde.<br/> 
		 I must have called a thousand tiiiimmmes<br/> 
		 to tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done.<br/> 
		 But when I call you never seem to be home.<br/> 
		 Hello from the other siiiiiiddde.<br/> 
		 At least I can say that I triiiieeeddd<br/> 
		 to tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart.<br/> 
		 But it don't matter,<br/> 
		 it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore.<br/>
		 Hello?<br/> 
		 How are you?<br/> 
		 It's so typical of me to talk about myself I'm sorry.<br/> 
		 I hope that you're well.<br/> 
		 Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?<br/> 
		 It's no secret that the both of us<br/> 
		 are running out of time.<br/>

		 When I up down touch the ground it puts me in the mood <br/>
		 Up down touch the ground, in the mood (smack smack) for food <br/>
		 I am stout, round and I have found speaking poundage wise <br/>
		 I improve my appetite when I excercise <br/>
		 Ohhh yes I am rumbly in my tumbly <br/>
		 I am short, fat and proud of that and so with all my might <br/>
		 I up down, up down to, my appetite's delight <br/>
		 When I up down, touch the ground I think of things to chew <br/>
		 A hefty happy appetite is a hefty happy Pooh!</center>
